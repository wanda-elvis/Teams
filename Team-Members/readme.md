## Team Collaboration Groups

In the pursuit of mastering DevOps and Cloud Engineering, we have organized our members into collaborative study groups. 
Each group is designed to foster teamwork, enhance learning, and facilitate the successful completion of assignments. 
These groups provide a platform for sharing knowledge, discussing complex topics, and working together on practical exercises.
